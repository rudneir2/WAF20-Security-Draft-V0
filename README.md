# WAF20 Security Draft V0

## Introduction to IT common environment

Microsoft Well-Architected Framework helps you understand how to apply the best practices in using Microsoft Security services in your IT environment based on Recommendations in different segments such as Security patterns, Application Secrets, Encryption, “Identity and Access”, Networking, Segmentation and “Test and validation”.
There are also other approaches that also cover Microsoft security and its best practices, so it is important to understand what the main objective of WAF is.
Below is a diagram that depicts what Microsoft security services are considered in WAF and different approaches, including the threats and the different methodologies that may be used to map threats.

## A common IT environment example

Before diving into different WAF segments and its recommendations based on Microsoft security services, it is important to understand how to apply those recommendations in a real IT environment. To make that understanding easier, below there is a very common IT environment that may be found in many companies from different industries.

The IT environment above describes a hybrid IT environment with a layer of Azure public cloud, an on-premises, and an Office 365 public services. Each box describes some of the common services.
Now, let’s include the layer of threats so we may understand the different threat actors that may be involved in an attack and the different tactics, techniques, and tools to compromise the IT environment.

## An example of Threat Map

Most common Threats diagram includes some examples of tactics and techniques based on Mitre Attack matrix and some examples of tools that are used by attackers.
It also includes some of the threat actors that may start an attack, such as remote admins, remote employees, your company’s clients, external developers that are not in the on-premises network perimeter, and any anonymous attacker that may initiate an attack against your environment.
